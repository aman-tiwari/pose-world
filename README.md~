# pytorch_Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation
This is a pytorch version of Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation, origin code is here https://github.com/ZheC/Realtime_Multi-Person_Pose_Estimation 

## Introduction
Code repo for reproducing 2017 CVPR Oral paper using pytorch.  

## Contents
1. [Testing](#testing)
2. [Training](#training)

## Require
1. [Pytorch](http://pytorch.org/)
2. [Caffe](http://caffe.berkeleyvision.org/) is required if you want convert caffe model to a pytorch model.

## Testing
- `cd model; sh get_model.sh` to download caffe model or download converted pytorch model.
- `cd caffe_to_pytorch; python convert.py` to convert a trained caffe model to pytorch model. The converted model have relative error less than 1e-6, and will be located in `./model` after converted.
- `pythont picture_demo.py` to run the picture demo.
- `pythont web_demo.py` to run the web demo.

## Training
