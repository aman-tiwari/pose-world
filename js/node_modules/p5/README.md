# [p5.js](http://p5js.org)

[Hello!](http://hello.p5js.org/) p5.js is a JavaScript library that starts with the original goal of Processing, to make coding accessible for artists, designers, educators, and beginners, and reinterprets this for today's web.

Using the original metaphor of a software sketchbook, p5.js has a full set of drawing functionality. However, you're not limited to your drawing canvas, you can think of your whole browser page as your sketch! For this, p5.js has addon libraries that make it easy to interact with other HTML5 objects, including text, input, video, webcam, and sound.

p5.js is a new interpretation, not an emulation or port, and it is in active development. An official editing environment is coming soon, as well as many more features!

If you already know the basics of JS or Processing, the [p5.js overview](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/p5.js-overview) wiki page is a good place to start. The [frequently asked questions](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) might also be helpful.

If you have found a bug in the p5.js library, you can file it here under the [“issues” tab](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/issues).
